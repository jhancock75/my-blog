My name is Jake, I am interested in innovative technology that seeks to improve the world, especially in regards to sustainability and healthcare. 

I am currently working as a graduate research assistant for the <a href="https://narslab.org/">Network for Accessibility, Resilience, and Sustainability Lab (NARS Lab)</a> while pursuing a Master's in Business & Analytics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. My lab focuses on advancing methods in network science, data mining, machine learning and simulation to analyze complex systems, with the end objective of developing resilient and sustainable communities. My research specifically involves developing an interpretable machine learning framework that can accurately predict electrical energy usage in clusters of buildings, such as a college campus.

Prior to this, I received a B.S. in Industrial Engineering, also from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. During my undergraduate career, I was able to explore many fields, ranging from pre-veterinary science to biochemical engineering. In this time, I also was given the opportunity to conduct research in multiple labs, the first of which being on  donkey and alpaca reproduction for <a href="https://www.nunoaproject.org/">The Nu√±oa Project</a> and the second being on the development of an in-vitro stem cell fertilization model that could mimic in-vivo stem cell growth for the <a href="https://blogs.umass.edu/ybsun/">Laboratory for Multiscale Bioengineering and Mechanobiology</a> at the <a href="https://www.umass.edu/ials/">Institute for Applied Life Sciences (IALS)</a>.
